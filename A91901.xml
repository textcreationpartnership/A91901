         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>Lo here he concludes both Petitions and Petitioners to the Houſe of Parliament to be

For what diſturbance or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion was thereby either plotted or practiſed through them, either againſt King or State? what breach of Law? or publique peace? only as members ſenſible of the great jeopeardy the whole Body was in, they humbly fought for redreſſe to the Fountain of ſuccour and juſtice. And every one as a private <hi>(b)</hi> man hath an intereſt in the publique ſtate and cauſe of the Land. For it is not onely one mans cauſe, but every ones, and we are all members one of another. And as every particular member doth partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the univerſall health or ſickneſſe of the body, and as every member naturall, doth grow and proſper according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature or ſound conſtitution of the heart or brain, from whence and on which its whole life and motion doth depend: ſo is it in every member politique. And as the members corporall being hurt; ſick, or any wayes grieved, do by a naturall inſtinct and way inſcrutable forthwith look and ſend unto the prime parts before named for ſtrength and comfort, yea and ſecretly excite all the other parts alſo to be aſſiſtant. So queſtionleſſe may the members of the Body politique, finding themſelves wounded, weakned, and many wayes grieved by their oppreſſive foes, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156665:3"/> diſtractive fears, lawfully look up, and by humble Petition ſue unto the King and Parliament (both which are one) the verie heart and head, life and being of this priſtine land and Nation, and of every true member of the ſame, yea and invite others alſo to aſſiſt them therein. The woman in her diſtreſſe cried to the King of Iſrael for help, when it was not in his power to help, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 26, 27. And ſhall not we pray help my Lord O King? Nay help, O ye Noble Senators, ye Parliament, in whoſe power it is (through Gods good hand upon them) to help us. For (bleſſed be our God) our caſe is not yet like the womans. And if mine Author be a <hi>(c)</hi> Proteſtant, (as he boaſteth himſelf) and that in
<hi>re,</hi> and not onely <hi>nomine:</hi> he ought the rather to ſue in the Proteſtants behalf, and be the more forward in promoting their cauſe unleſſe he be a withered branch, and live inſenſible of the generall calamitie, and ſo more fit to be cut off then nouriſhed. Who will ſeek and ſue if the Proteſtant do not, neither the Papiſt, nor the Atheiſt? nay, who ſhould ſeek but the Proteſtant? For his cauſe it is even his onely. But mine Author is like the men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that being called would not go, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12. 2. and will abuſe his brethren for going, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. But let him take heed, as like as he would ſeem to be a <note n="*" place="margin">Anguis later ſub herba.</note>

6. And if none but <hi>(d)</hi> Law-makers ought to petition, then the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament men themſelves ſhould onely petition, and what needed that? know they not their own minds? and if the thing, to wit, petitioning, be <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> unlawfull, as he argueth againſt the Petitioners, then I conceive it is much more unlawfull in the Law-makers, (as in <hi>Majore)</hi> then it is in others: But if it be lawfull in the Law-makers, as by that word (d) <hi>Law-maker</hi> he inferres, then it is alſo lawfull in others, and ſo in the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Beſides, freedome of information, and to make our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances known is a chiefe priviledge of Parliament, and of us by the Parliament. And what (e) <hi>command</hi> more authentique then liberty confirmed by Law? And although many have petitioned that there may be (f) <hi>no Biſhops,</hi> yet have they but done what they ought, and what their oath doth require. For both their ſtandings and preſent titles (as ſhall hereafter be fully proved) are altogether Popiſh and unlawfull: and to will that theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates may have <hi>no Votes in the houſe</hi> (g) <hi>of Peers,</hi> who can deny
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156665:4"/> it to be a thing not onely lawfull but expedient? for can a man ſerve two Maſters? no more can they ſerve two offices. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this ſure can become no ſuch heavy burthen to my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors (h) <hi>conſcience,</hi> eſpecially having received ſo much (i) <hi>light</hi> as he boaſteth of. Nor need he fear to comply herein with the people, for theſe their humble ſupplications cannot by any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctors be accounted (k)
<hi>diſtempers.</hi> Indeed well he may do, not to follow the (l) <hi>ſtream of a multitude to do evil,</hi> for at this time it is ſo violent and ſtrong as that perhaps it may ſuddenly carry him to ruine headlong. But the Petitioners part is not this multitude: for <hi>(comparatis comparandis)</hi> comparing them with the Adverſaries they are but a manuall. And it is certain they are fewer in number that deſire the good of Zion, and of the Citie Jeruſalem, then they that hate it. But all this by the way upon his <hi>Exordium</hi> or Entrance.

            <p>Here he confeſſeth himſelf ſolemnly to have (m) <hi>taken the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation for the maintenance of the true Reformed Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and yet is his writing againſt all ſuch as according to this Proteſtation and their conſcience do ariſe and apply themſelves to the maintenance and defence of the ſame Religion, making the Proteſtation which is the very ground and ſtrongeſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Petitioners performance, his prime argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them therefrom; ſo perniciouſly inverting the end of the Proteſtation, as if it had been ordained, and by the Worthies of the Land taken and to us commended, rather for the quenching that little love of the truth, and zeal of Gods worſhip which is in men, then any wayes to inflame and excitate the ſame, and for the ſhutting men up in ſilence, and tying them up from action, rather then to imbolden and ſtrengthen them both by word and deed to further the work of Reformation, and the building up
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156665:4"/> of the houſe of God. And although he hath ſworn to defend this Religion againſt all <hi>(n)</hi> Poperie and Popiſh Innovations, yet he maketh his oath the cauſe of his refuſing to joyn with others in lawfull means for the defence thereof, and thus he overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his firſt <note n="*" place="margin">As read and mark it.</note> ground and plea from thence. For if the Proteſtation doth bind a man (as indeed it doth, and ſo himſelf confeſſeth) to defend the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, and to oppoſe all Poperie and Popiſh innovations, how then is he left free? what excuſe can it be to him? not onely for his ſitting ſtill and giving way to Poperie (for he that is not with us is againſt us) but alſo for his oppoſition againſt ſuch as in diſcharge of their oath do ſtir in defence of the true Proteſtant Religion, and expulſion of poperie and popiſh Innovation. The Proteſtation hath not Twinnes in it, it comprehends not contraries, nor doth it leave a man to his own pleaſure. Therefore being thus taken by him, it doth for his negligence and averſeneſſe plainly condemne him: and better had it been for him never to have taken it, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken it not to keep it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 4. for the oath is not with man, but with God. When the people of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> had ſworn and entred into covenant with God,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 5. ſo ſoon as the Prieſt had told them their ſin, and what they ſhould do to glorifie God, they preſently conſent and put it in practiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12. We have ſworn and entred covenant with our God, and our Prieſts, the faithfull Miniſters of God, have told us our ſin, and what the ſtrange thing is we muſt put from us, that God may be glorified by us: and is it not lawfull for us to ſue for a Bill of divorcement, yea to divorce our ſelves? For we have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our ſtrange Ceremonies and Service, as well as ever the Jews loved their ſtrange wives. And although we lay not hands upon vain croſſes and pictures, Copes and Surplices, Organs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and the reſt of the Whores Dreſſe, yet give us leave at leaſt to petition, that they may be all aboliſhed; and that with all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, 2
<hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 1. we may now at length break down all the Altars and Images, and caſt away all vain Ceremonies out of the ſervice of God throughout the whole Land. For theſe muſt be removed before our oaths can be fulfilled, or God truly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And whereas in the cloſe of his firſt ground he ratifieth the reaſon of his refuſall, by vertue of the 36. <hi>Article of the ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed doctrine of the Church of England, wherein the office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:156665:5"/> 
               <hi>is incluſively confirmed.</hi> I anſwer. The Proteſtation bindeth not to the maintenance of the whole and ſole Doctrine compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and expreſſed in that book, nor of any part thereof, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and further then it conſents with the wholſome words of Chriſt, for the very words in the oath are, the <hi>(o)</hi> true <note n="*" place="margin">Note I pray.</note> reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtant Religion; Now in that ſame book, and in many of thoſe deviſed Articles, are many things contained and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are not truly reformed, (or rather conformed) to Gods holy Word. And therefore our Oath is of a larger extent, and we are thereby bounden even to oppoſe thoſe Articles, and the whole form of Doctrine and diſcipline comprehended in them, ſo far forth as they and it be not oppoſite to Poperie and Popiſh Innovation, and diſſent from the truth of Reformation: and this is more amply and obviouſly expreſſed in that reſolving clauſe next under and adjoyning to the Proteſtation. It is true that in the ſaid (p) 36. <hi>Article</hi> the conſecration of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, are there allowed, according to the manner uſed at the firſt beginning of Reformation in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. But that therein or thereby, either Archbiſhops or Lordbiſhops, are juſtified or juſtifiable by Gods Word, I do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read nor beleeve And therefore his ſecret fear of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an

Beſides, grant what he pleads for: that the preſent office of the Biſhops as it is at this day executed by them, be by a Law of Parliament confirmed, as lawfull by Gods Word: Is it therefore lawfull by the Word of God? No. There is neither Law nor Counſell againſt Gods Law: his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are like himſelf pure and unalterable, and need not the frothy device of men either to illuſtrate or authoriſe them. And as for Archbiſhops and Biſhops (nay and Prebends and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons too) I am certain there is neither precept, nor pattern in holy Writ for them, many againſt them. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8. 10, 11. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 35. and 10. 42, 43, 44.

And that a Biſhop and an Elder are one (to omit other Scriptures) it is evident by comparing the 7. verſe of the 1. Chap. of <hi>Titus</hi> with the fifth verſe. And if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a Biſhop or an Elder, and another Miniſter, a true Paſtor or a Teacher, it is in this that the Biſhop hath the greater care and burden, and therefore ought to be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and watchfull: But our Biſhops will have other Miniſters to differ nothing from them in pains and care, unleſſe it be in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more then they do; for indeed they take none at all.

               <hi>powers and priviledges of Parliaments, which is chiefly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the</hi> (q) <hi>eſtabliſhed Laws concerning the ſame. Now ſeverall</hi> (r) <hi>Acts of Parliament do not onely confirm as aforeſaid the office of a Biſhop, but by the powers and priviledges of thoſe Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are alſo to ſit as Members of the Lords Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray obſerve how this man doth prepoſterouſly tye the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> of Parliament on the <hi>(q)</hi> Acts of Parliament. <hi>Cujus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium verum eſt,</hi> the contrary whereof is true. For (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive) the Laws by them made, make not their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: But they by vertue of that inherent priviledge and power,
<hi>ab initio,</hi> eſtabliſhed on them, as the repreſentative body of the whole kingdom, are inabled both to enact Laws, and if cauſe be, to repeal them, as the cauſe produceth the effect. Otherwiſe it could not be that we ſhould be our own Law-makers: and in my underſtanding we are called a free people, becauſe we are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a free Law, and not by conſtrained Ordinances violently obtruded againſt our wills upon us. The bounds of our Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum;</hi> and the <hi>Ends, Defence and Freedome.</hi> And therefore we are not free becauſe the Laws do make us free, for by our Laws we are bound and muſt obey: But becauſe we have free power to make ſuch Laws unto which we willingly do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and obey. Now that theſe priviledges of Parliament are confirmed by Law, is undeniable: and therefore he that violates the leaſt of them is puniſhed as a Law-breaker: But that there may be Laws or Acts altered and repealed, and no priviledge broken is manifeſt, and one Parliament may, and we know doth often alter and abrogate what another did eſtabliſh and enact. <hi>Ergo</hi> the maintenance of priviledges of Parliament is not to be underſtood chiefly of the Laws thereby eſtabliſhed; but of the legiſlative power, priviledges, and libertie, wherewith they of the Parliament are inveſted as of right, and (as I may ſay) <hi>in feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſimpli,</hi> for the doing of whatſoever ſhall ſeem good unto them for the honour of the King, relief of the Subject, and good of the Kingdom, the which they lively perſonate. Therefore it is that their power, their priviledges, and perſonall liberties, which we are more principally bound to defend, and moſt nearly doth this concern us. For the life and libertie, eſtate, welfare, and verie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156665:6"/> being (under God) of you and me, and of every man and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Kingdom is wrapt up in them and their priviledges: And if we ſtand onely in defence of the Laws enacted (as they of the <note n="*" place="margin">The Kings Army in the North, who under colour of maintaining the Law, would have imployed their Forces againſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> for the ſupport of Biſhops.</note> Army in pretext would have done) and not of their perſons and rights to them adherent as they are Parliament men: We may have ſtill our old Laws (if not our old oppreſſions) but no execution of them, our Law-makers being illegally taken from us, as wofull experience of late had almoſt <note n="*" place="margin">The caſe is plain, becauſe the accuſation was palpable.</note> taught us. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>ſeverall</hi> (r) <hi>Asts of Parliament do confirm both Biſhops and their Votes in the Lords Houſe,</hi> yet neither Biſhops, nor their votes are therefore lawfull nor yet neceſſarie: Neither cuſtome nor antiquitie can juſtifie falſhood, or tolerate incommoditie. As for Biſhops, I have ſpoken ſomewhat alreadie ſufficient (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) for this Treatiſe, they are a theme requiring a more ample diſcuſſion. And as for their votes in Parliament, it hath been proved, and long ſince adjudged that a Parliament may be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute without them,
<note n="*" place="margin">De Doctor Standiſh.</note> 7. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and often have Laws been made and ratified by the Parliament without them, 25. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and 35. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and 7.
<hi>R.</hi> 2. and what may be done, in this caſe, at one time may be done at any time, and therefore it followeth there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of them, and what ſhould any member unneceſſarily do there? Beſides, the Biſhops right in Parliament is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then that of the Noble Peers, for that of the Peers is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and hereditary; but the Biſhops theirs is onely <hi>durante bene placito,</hi> during the Kings pleaſure, or ſo long as they ſhall pleaſe him. For they ſit there but by their Maſters favour, and what hope of good from him that is diſſwaded through fear or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded for favour? Again it is incongruous and inconſiſtent with their <note n="*" place="margin">See the Speech of the Right Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> againſt the temporall power of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> function. The Biſhops have often uſed that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi> let no man meddle out of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to ſilence the juſt reproofs againſt them; when as indeed it might more juſtly have been objected to them: <hi>Ne Epiſcopus verò ultra Eccleſiam.</hi> But let not a Biſhop leave the Church. But I will deſiſt from further proſecution of this point, becauſe (bleſſed be God) we have our deſire in this matter moſt rightfully alreadie granted. Howſoever thus much may ſuffice to prove that ſuch as have petitioned againſt Biſhops and their votes in Parliament, have done nothing againſt their oath, as my Author doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156665:7"/> infer, but truly done their duty, and diſcharged their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And ſo I come to my Authors third ground in theſe words following, <hi>fol.</hi> 3.

Again the</hi> (t) <hi>making and repealing of laws for the good of the Common-wealth, is a ſpeciall and peculiar power, priviledge, and right, proper</hi> (t) <hi>onely to Parliaments. Therefore not to be</hi> (v) <hi>forcedor coacted by me being no Parliament man.

I had almoſt thought him to be of thoſe that would lately have had them in priſon. And again here he grants that it is <hi>onely</hi> (t) <hi>proper to Parliament men to make Laws and repeal them,</hi> the which I am ſure they can never do without their liberty, to convene and conſult, and therefore (as I have already ſaid) it is not ſo much the eſtabliſhed Laws, as the power, priviledges, and perſonall liberties of Parliament men (whileſt they are ſo, and do onely what is meet) that we muſt defend. Nor hath any man aſſumed this power and proprietie, but they (as I know) though my Author doth inſinuate
<hi>(t)</hi> ſo. Unleſſe it be ſuch as would limit their Councels, and propoſe them a way after their own fancies, accounting all that is done by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, contrary to their crooked will and liking, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to law and juſtice: for there is a generation, with whom onely <hi>quod libet licet,</hi> what pleaſeth is lawfull. But the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners are not of this kind, and therefore not thus preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for they onely ſue for juſtice, not directing but begging re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156665:7"/> But toward the end my Author imputes <hi>an enforcement</hi> (v) <hi>or coaction</hi> to ſuch as petition them. What impulſion he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth I am ignorant, for I am privie to none (I am ſure not that <note n="*" place="margin">By the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valliers and broken Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> martiall commination <hi>Januar.</hi> 4. for in all his diſcourſe he doth not ſo much as blow upon it.) And what way more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and leſſe offenſive then ſupplication? and what way more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe and tolerable then petition? Sure he is rapt in the ſpirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating divine deprication, then which with God nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is more forcible: But I think I may rather ſay unto him, <hi>Satin' ſanus es?</hi> is he well in his wits? for what is more lawfull, nay more needfull and commendable? then to ask things lawfull whether from God above, or of the gods belowe, eſpecially with this concluſion, humbly ſubjecting to their grave wiſedom, as it is well known all our Petitioners have done. Again what man diſtempered in mind, ſick, or maimed in body, or crazed in eſtate, will not diſcover to his Divine, Phyſitian, or Lawyer, his grief, yea, and the cauſe too if he can? earneſtly imploring help and comfort from him, nay not ceaſe untill (if it may be) he hath in ſome good meaſure obtained it. And hath not the whole mind and body (to wit) both the Miniſtery and Magiſtracie of the Land, and every living member thereof, been grievouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, ſick and wounded? and whom ſhould we inform and make acquainted with our deſperate maladies and their cauſes?

Yet as the Patient doth alway find and feele ſomewhat more in himſelf then the Doctor can diſcover or diſcern: So doth the great Patient our Land and Kingdom, find and feele many cloſe and inward griefs, which that learned Doctor the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot of it ſelf eſpie, and therefore on neceſſitie muſt be by their great Patient the people, informed of, or elſe they can mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter no remedie.

            <p>It is ill to be ſick, but much worſe not to ſeek cure. Beſides, he is but an ill ſervant and a negligent, that while his maſter is buſie in

The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Parliament is our Privie Councell Chamber, or the great withdrawing roome of the Kingdom, where they, as ſo many great State Maſters, do ſit in conſultation and ſtrict examination of our publique eſtate and welfare. The whole Land is the ſhop of all manner of intercourſe and negotiation. We ſhould prove our ſelves but very bad members, remiſſe ſervants and careleſſe, if while our great Maſters were thus buſied within, we ſhould not once look about in the ſhop in the common-wealth, every man according to his ſeverall place, and if we ſee or foreſee any evill preſent or approaching, not yeeld them intelligence, that ſo they may happily make prevention.

Yet one thing more then meer obedience to the Law, is every one that hath taken the Proteſtation bound unto (that is) to do their beſt to bring every one that doth diſobey the Laws to condigne puniſhment, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there can be but little peace, be you and I never ſo obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and the beſt way to conſerve peace, is to endeavour the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all the perturbers thereof, which are the violators of the Laws, the bonds of our peace: and herein have the Petitioners but juſtly alſo fulfilled their oath, in praying the execution of the Laws upon all Recuſants and Delinquents, who have ever been the onely Authors of our unquietneſſe, ſeeking ſtill to break our bands, our Laws, and to caſt our cords (to wit) our Statutes from them. But as for my Author, I do not underſtand that he deſireth any ſuch execution, for he rather judgeth the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners for juſtice, breakers of the Laws, then keepers of them, and this he ſecretly <hi>(x)</hi> implyeth, though not openly averreth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo I come to his fifth ground, <hi>fol.</hi> 4. <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>It is a ſhame for a Teacher to reprehend that in another, he is guilty of himſelf, or to lay his own fault to anothers charge: the caſe in this place is my Authors, and by this he plainly proves himſelf to be a Delinquent, at the leaſt of the Delinquent partie, <hi>(utrum vult)</hi> let him take his choice: for he is not content in this particular to violate his oath alone, but alſo by his writing and ſlye ſuggeſtions, ſeduceth and procureth others to do the ſame.

               <hi>like. This</hi> (b) <hi>betraying others thereunto, and making them guiltie of ſo ſolemne a vow, is an offence of an high nature both to God, and our governours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is nothing to the purpoſe: onely he doth ſeem to <hi>(a)</hi> tax <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſome body, but nominates no body: and therefore indeed doth juſtly deſerve to be taxed himſelf. For if he know any man guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the (b)
<hi>betraying</hi> he ſpeaketh of, let him detect him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and touch him boldly, or elſe (as I ſaid before) himſelf is conſcious of what he objects againſt others.

And if any hath for (c) <hi>hope, fear, or favour, relinquiſhed the promiſe and vow,</hi> it is he, and ſuch as he, (and not the Petitioners at whom ſtill he ſecretly girds) for albeit he hath taken it, his own mouth witneſſeth that he hath departed from it, becauſe inſtead of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Poperie, and Popiſh Innovation, he pleadeth for Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and their Papall government, and oppoſeth all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, inſtead of applying himſelf to defend the Parliament, he applyeth himſelf to deterre and dehort others from doing it: and inſtead of uſing the beſt means for bringing Delinquents to be puniſhed, he uſeth the beſt means to excuſe them, and to accuſe others who have endeavoured their puniſhment. And ſure if he was not ſome Biſhops favourite, ſtood not in ſome place, credit, or grace by their favour, or at leaſt a favourer of their faction, and ſo in hope by them to be remunerated, or in fear to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, he would not have taken ſuch a circuit, and traced ſuch a round, for their defence and juſtification. As for the Petitioners, what hope could they have more then to be delivered from ſuch ſoul-oppreſſing Tyrants? what ſhould they fear but the ſpight of the prelaticall partie? and what favour could they expect? when all men for the moſt part then favoured the prelacie.

            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:156665:10"/> True it is, that he is bound by the Proteſtation to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> of nothing <hi>further then he lawfully may.</hi> Nevertheleſſe let him not uſe this argument for the maintenance of things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and for the diſcouragement of ſuch as rightfully ſeek the ablation of them. For as it enjoyneth onely a lawfull defence: ſo it injoyneth the defence onely of lawfull things. By which word (d)
<hi>lawfully,</hi> I do chiefly underſtand according unto conſcience: otherwiſe we ſhould be bound by our Proteſtation to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of ſome laws and things thereby eſtabliſhed, altogether unlawfull and againſt the Word of God, even ſuch as are moſt offenſive, and we have ſworn againſt. But that this (even conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) is the principall (e) <hi>ſcope of the Proteſtation,</hi> and of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and commenders thereof, let him that readeth it conſider, and he ſhall find it evident: and not that our actions either of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bounded or reſtrained by the Laws Nationall, then that they concurre with the Law of God, and conduce to the advancement of his truth and glory; if it was not thus, we had ſworn to man, and not to God, nay we had ſworn with man againſt God. But it is clear, and whoſe ſoul tels him not, that this oath is unto God, and with God, yea and in the preſence of God. Let no man therefore be deceived, God is not mocked: He is wiſe in heart, and mighty in ſtrength; who hath hardned himſelf againſt him and proſpered? <hi>Job</hi> 9. 4. The law of the Land therefore is not to be taken principally for the bounds and limits of our Oath, but the law of God; and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully may we oppoſe the law of man ſo farre forth as it oppoſeth the Law of God, and conſenteth not therewith, and yet prove our ſelves both loyall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Subjects, and conſerve our Oath, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 28, 29.

And a man may as ſoon (and ſooner if the heads or chief propoſers be not honeſt and ſound men) be ſeduced and drawn to ſet his hand contrary

Becauſe the greater ſort of men are like ſheep led by example; ſome relying on the judgement of particular men, who are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent amongſt them for knowledge; others being afraid to refuſe the thing (though they doubt and inwardly are unwilling) leſt they ſhould be counted ſingular, and more nice and wiſe then all the Countrey. Whereas whatſoever is propounded in private, or at home, is alway more maturely digeſted, the perſon taking boldneſſe to require reſpite, both to examine and conſider it. And for my Authors
<hi>(i)</hi> example, it is not conſonant, it concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not. For what is done in that
<hi>election,</hi> is according to the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Kings ſpeciall power and Prerogative. The Sheriffes, Juſtices, and other Offices, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein of their own free motion, by vertue of priviledge onely as the Subjects do which petition: But in obedience to his Majeſties Writ and precept. And how expedient it is that the whole County or City, even to the loweſt member, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the election of the perſon which is to be inſtead of their perſons, and the head and mouth of them, I appeal to all men. For the particular eſtates, intereſts, and liberties of every one of them is intruſted with him: But in caſe of petitioning, there is no ſuch neceſſity, every man feels the generall evill, but every man deſireth not the expurgation of it, nor doth every man know the cauſe of it, and therefore cannot make a particular remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, and ſue for peculiar redreſſe. And becauſe every man ſeeth not the reaſon of the epidemicall maladie, and ſo knoweth not what meanes to uſe for remedie, and others that do ſee it as dead members deſire no cure of it, ſhall not therefore ſuch as both know the cauſe and way of cure, and thirſt after it, uſe the means, law and liberty hath allowed, for the effecting it? it were unreaſonable to deny it. Neither doth the <hi>aſſent of a</hi> (k) <hi>Skeriffe, Juſtice of Peace, or other Magiſtrate,</hi> argue any thing lawfull, no more then the preaching of falſe doctrine by a publique Miniſter doth prove it true; the Laws are to be the rules of our civill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not their licence. Too many things (freſh ſtill in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance) have been both commanded and countenanced by Sheriffes and <note n="*" place="margin">Prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſeizing of mens goods, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their perſons.</note> Magiſtrates, which we know will neither ſtand
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156665:11"/> with the Law of God, nor of the Nation. And if the Sheriffes or Magiſtrates aſſent and propoſition make an Act lawfull, then the bloody Rebels in <hi>Ireland</hi> are juſtifiable. For (as report tels) they had for their beginning the conſent both of
<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>Phileme Oneale,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Peers &amp; Juſtices of the Peace there.</note> Sheriffes and Magiſtrates; yea themſelves affirm authority for their preſent actions. Again, as there is no generall rule without its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar exception, ſo there is no particular or extraordinary exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be taken for a generall rule. <hi>Ergo,</hi> though a univerſall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and aſſent be neceſſarily required in the choice of Knights and Burgeſſes for the Parliament, yet it followeth not that the like is requiſite in the way of Petitions to the Parliament. Now whereas he cals the Petitions <hi>Clandeſtine actions,</hi> that is, hidden and cloſe, done in hugger mugger, and <hi>ſurreptitious,</hi> that is, as it were by ſtealth, how unſavourie this is, let every one that hath but a clear ſence prove and trie.

And for that he ſaith they did it without the (l) <hi>conſent and commiſſion of Authoritie.</hi> I anſwer: They had authoritie both ſtrong and ſufficient. Firſt, their own right.

For this is one of the prime proprieties appertaining unto Parliaments, to receive and hear the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the people, and a grand priviledge of the Subjects, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without curb or prohibition of Magiſtrates and Officers to <note n="*" place="margin">See the right worthy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Sir <hi>Arthur Haſelriggs</hi> Speech in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the other accuſed Members,</note> impart their grievances, and ſeek for relief to the Parliament. And if we might not petition without the Sheriffes, Magiſtrates, and Officers conſent of the City or County where we live, we ſhould be but ſtill in bondage. For our task-maſters would but revile us when we ſhould come to crave their aſſents, and ſay (with my Author) that we were idle and
<hi>factious.</hi> For it may be theſe are the very cauſes we muſt complain of, and it cannot be that they will write againſt themſelves. And ſo the evill cauſes might ſtill remain, and we poore Subjects ſtill groane under the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects. For the evill the Parliament knoweth not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amend. Beſides, admit that not onely Magiſtrates, but all ſorts of people (as there are too many evilly affected) ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to joyn with me in petition for redreſſe and reformation. Is it unlawfull therefore for me to petition, becauſe I am left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and the cauſe is diſerted of all men? No. (to omit private intereſt and reſpect) In caſe that the welfare and being of the Land and Nation, City or Countrey where I live, and whereof I am member, is in jeopardy and danger, I ought and it is my bounden dutie, (though it be with my life in my hand) to make known the diſtreſſes thereof to the Miniſters raiſed by God for preſervation and redreſſe, and alſo to uſe thoſe means God hath put into my hands for the redemption and deliverance of that place and people. Read that hiſtory of

But this is like the reſt, and ill will never ſpake well. For is a certifying of their griefs with humble ſupplication that they may be eaſed, and all things troubleſome to conſcience (againſt which they have vowed) removed, a breach of their Proteſtation? <hi>Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um verò verum.</hi> It is onely the reall keeping of it, indeed had they

But none of them againſt whom he intends, have been thus <note n="*" place="margin">As were of late ſome Kentiſh men.</note> inſnared, and therefore-his words here are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and ſcandalous. Neither have any been (n) <hi>enforced</hi> (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully ſpeaks) to ſubſcribe their hands, for their own free wils have been their firſt movers, and their own underſtandings their chief Councellors. Nor is their ground or reaſon to force any in this action, where is their authority? where their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? neither would it ought avail or be profitable. Yea it would prove very pernicious and prejudiciall: But becauſe my Author hath ſeen ſuch great multitudes to accord in this thing, therefore (I beleeve) the greater hath his ſpight and grief been. And now I hope I have effectually proved thoſe works by my Author injuriouſly called <hi>unlawfull, and works of darkneſſe,</hi> to be both lawfull and works of the light, as clear as the Sun in his ſtrength. And whereas he ſaith they will not (o) <hi>endure the light, Omnibus eſt notum.</hi> It is well known to all men they have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the very eye of light, for all they againſt which my Author writes have had the full approbation and kind acceptation of the Parliament, who are even as an Angel of light. And ſo I come to his ſecond and third cauſe why he is not ſatisfied with their manner of proceeding. For I will put them both together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are both of a nature, <hi>fo.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>viz.</hi>

<hi>Landlords and Cuſtomers, or for</hi> (r) <hi>vain glory, that it may be ſaid, this is the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell which they have wrought with their own hands: and ſome few of thoſe ſhall ingage and prejudice others, (and not without cauſe as it is to be feared) by falſe informations and reaſons to make men ſubſcribe. Thirdly, the like ſiniſter proceedings are to be ſuppoſed in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber. Theſe kind of wayes by tumults and multitudes without legall allegations and probations, to compaſſe that by will which you cannot obtain by reaſon, is of a dangerous</hi> (t) <hi>conſequence, and threatens</hi> (u) <hi>the ſubverſion of all government and governours. For which of</hi>

               <hi>them, be they never ſo good, ſhall be ſecure if the multitude of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered people pleaſe to will the contrary? Theſe cauſe much diſtractions, hinder the</hi> (s) <hi>proceedings of the State, and the relief of the oppreſſed; breake our bleſſed</hi> (w) <hi>unity, and bring the Actors within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a</hi> (x)
<hi>puniſhment from the law of God and man, for not walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the expreſſed Statutes contained therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In both theſe ſecond and third cauſes I conceive little ſaid, but <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> what hath already been ſpoken and inſerted. See his ſixth ground where he ſecretly accuſeth ſome for breach of their oath for ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ends,
<hi>as fear, favour, &amp;c.</hi> and ſee his third ground where he condemneth the Petitioners for <hi>enforcing that by will, which they cannot obtain by reaſon.</hi> See alſo to the latter end of his firſt <hi>cauſe,</hi> where he ſpeaketh of <hi>ingaging men to breake their oath, and of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing them thereunto, &amp;c.</hi> all which particulars are in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places already anſwered. Yet by the way mark with me, I pray, how ſlily he ſeeketh to divide between the <hi>Landlord</hi> (p) and the Tenant, a man and his friends; as if dependancie, alliance, and relation, was ſufficient cauſe to avert the one from perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the other from according to concurre in a good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Howſoever I will ſay ſomewhat more in the behalfe of the undertakers and ſubſcribers, becauſe in this place he ſpeaketh loud. How can any man in common ſenſe think the Petitioners (againſt whom he inveighs) did what they have done in a ſiniſter way, either for <hi>fear or favour?</hi> nay in humane judgement, they might at that time have rather feared for doing it, and have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed disfavour, for was not then both wind and tide againſt them? were not our chief adverſaries (the cauſe of all our troubles) then pregnant and powerfull above meaſure, threatning not onely the particular oppoſers of them, but even the ruin of the whole State and Kingdom? And for this cauſe to my knowledge many that were willing <note n="*" place="margin">For they ſaid, the popiſh Lords and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops will get the upperhand, and then all that give their hands againſt them will be queſtioned.</note> durſt not underwrite againſt them: and many that did, were drawn thereunto more by force of conſcience, through the Proteſtation, then any free will of their own, (though ardent in deſire) by reaſon of the dread they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the might and malice of them againſt whom they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned. So that if God had not wonderfully brought our foes down, the Petitioners had in ſtead of <hi>(q)</hi> gain ſuſtained incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſſe, for thoſe the enemies would certainly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:156665:13"/> us. And as for (r) <hi>vain glory, that it might be ſaid, this is the Babell they have wrought.</hi> It never, I am confident, entred into the Petitioners hearts, for their deſires and endeavours are to pull down Babel, and to raze it to the very bottome, even that Tower of confuſion which hath been here ſo long upheld by the Babyloniſh Prieſts and partie: that fame may tell future poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, this your fathers did. Laid <hi>Babylon</hi> waſte, expelled her Idol Prieſts, pulled down her high Altars and pleaſant pictures, and trod all her rich ornaments under ſeet, that ſo they might ſerve the Lord in truth and peace.

5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 22. And that the Petitioners and their petitions have not <hi>hindered,</hi> but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>proceedings</hi> of State, and prepared a way of <hi>relief for the oppreſſed,</hi> the bleſſed effects do teſtifie, and ſo apparantly the (t)
<hi>conſequence</hi> of theſe petitionarie wayes are not <hi>dangerous:</hi> and in ſtead of (u) <hi>threatning the ſubverſion of law, government, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> they do promiſe, nay almoſt aſſure us an eſtabliſhment of Law, government, and Governors, and that eſpecially of good ones; for if they be good, what cauſe will there be to petition againſt them? much leſſe to hurt them. Nor hath this way bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the (w) <hi>unity</hi> amongſtus, but the bonds it hath broken of our <hi>ſweet unity</hi> breakers. And what (x)
<hi>puniſhment</hi> can there be incurred, where no tranſgreſſion (as is proved) is committed? I am ſure God by his good ſucceſſe, and the Parliament by their good acceptance, have in ſtead of pronouncing the Petitioners guiltie, ſpoken them both innocent and honeſt, carefull and provident for their Countrey.

            <p>In his ſixth ground, <hi>fol.</hi> 5. of his book and elſewhere, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigheth
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> vehemently againſt ſuch as ſeduce others to break their Proteſtation: But if there be a more diabolicall meane or manner of ſeducement then this he here uſeth, judge ye: pretending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt conſcience, with the more facilitie to inſnare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For thus doth he lead captive the ſimple, vanquiſh the feeble, and repell the fearfull and faint hearted. As if he was the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156665:14"/> onely man, and <hi>(y)</hi> knowledge dwels onely with him. But if he have no more <hi>light</hi> then here ſhineth from him (for all his brags) he ſeeth no more then a
<hi>Beetle,</hi> and his <hi>underſtanding</hi> is no more then the <hi>Aſſes:</hi> ſenſuall and earthy. But he hath been taught by (z) <hi>affliction,</hi> and therefore you muſt beleeve him. I muſt confeſſe affliction maketh many wiſe ſcholers, but not every one, nor hath he (ſo farre as I can ſee) yet perfectly learned his leſſon, for if he had, or was ſenſible of trouble and oppreſſion, ſure he would omit no lawfull means for help and deliverance. I never knew but in any ſtreight or trouble, I might make uſe of all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes and occaſions for the procurement of my eaſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and that when God opened the doore, I not onely might (but ought) (otherwiſe I ſhould be guilty of contempt) to come forth and eſcape, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 8. 12. 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 9. 11. And we have all been a long time in bondage and ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, I hope ſeeing God is pleaſed by the Parliament, to open a doore unto us, yea and a wide one, it is lawfull for us to uſe our libertie, and to uſe thoſe means he doth ſo freely affoord us for our Reſtauration and re-eſtabliſhment. And ſo I come to more of his grounds, cauſes, or reaſons, or rather repetitions, for I cannot tell what truly to call them: But you ſhall have them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as I find them, <hi>fol.</hi> 8. <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>What reaſonable man will deny all this? onely let my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> prove, that <hi>the office</hi> of a Biſhop, as it is now by our Biſhops held and exerciſed, lawfull and lawfully uſed: it is much more eaſie to prove both, altogether unlawfull, and utterly to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and abandoned.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156665:14"/> publique authoritie and honour of God, and the very being or well-being of his people. Witneſſe that ever dreadfull ingurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and

But it is where the wrong is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, not Nationall; and principally concerning man, not God. But perhaps my Author here meaneth not this manner of ſuffering: but that for the faults of theſe Biſhops, future poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould be deprived of the like ſtate and preferment, power, and revenews. Truly cuſtome is no ſound plea for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an evill cauſe. And ſeeing theſe men have uſurped the place and authoritie not due unto them, and have enjoyed more wealth and honour then hath been fit or profitable for them, all which meerly tend to inſnare and corrupt men of holy function, fraighting them full (as experience plainly proveth) with all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:156665:15"/> manner of pride and inſolence, impietie and idleneſſe. It cannot be adjudged either improvidence, or injuſtice, to aboliſh theſe exorbitant uſurpations, of honour, authority and power in them, and to convert their ſuperabundant rents and revenews to ſome more neceſſarie and pious uſes, that ſo the like enormities which in theſe perſons have by theſe means hitherto accrewed, may in ſucceeding ages be prevented. And this can be no ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the future generation, becauſe they are ſpoiled of nothing. But this I humbly refer to them, whom it doth more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally as Judges concern. Onely thus much for anſwer herein to my Author, and ſo I come to his other matter.

               <hi>guiltie of</hi> (f) <hi>foule offences, and it may be with the children of Iſrael, they have not worſhipped the true God as they ought, and have incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Idolatry, and thereby juſtly provoked the Almighty to wrath and indignation againſt them. Yet I am perſwaded that for the very execution of their</hi> (h) <hi>office, and the</hi> (g) <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Laws for the</hi> (k) <hi>unity and peace of the Church they ſuffer inſtrumentally by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ill</hi> (l) <hi>affected to government, or by ſuch as have been puniſhed by them for doing</hi> (i) <hi>contrary thereunto: and if the like proceedings may be ſuffered againſt all</hi> (m) <hi>Judges, and other</hi> (n) <hi>executioners of the Laws of the Kingdom, there ſhall be no</hi> (o) <hi>ſecure execution of the Laws againſt offenders, and ſo we ſhall live lawleſſe, and let in</hi>

               <hi>all manner of diſorder and vice, murther, rapine, and the like. Thoſe Biſhops rather (under correction) that have done contrary</hi> (p) <hi>to the Law, are to be puniſhed by the Law, on due and true proofs, and not according to your wils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this inſtance and what followeth, you may plainly ſee <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> what ſtamp my Author is of, what I all the way feared, he hath here verified. For he is a worſhipper of the great gods of theſe times the ambitious Prelates; who lifted up themſelves above all that is called God. But as they have been exalted, ſo (bleſſed be God) have they lately been humbled. But he ſaith, that (e) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity hath made them faulty:</hi> it is true. For many of them before they were Biſhops, were daily and diligent fiſhermen, drawing many unto God: but having caught what they fiſhed for, (the world and preferment) they preſently left both their nets, and the waters their Miniſterie and the Word, and forthwith fell to drive men from God; with <hi>Demas</hi> giving themſelves up to the preſent world. Howbeit in as much as their exuberancy of wealth, and lordly power, inſtead of advancing them forward, hath become an impediment to the diſcharge of their duties, and are the chief means to canker and corrupt them: the grave and gracious Parliament, (I beleeve, as is moſt meet) will impaire and leſſen them, that being rid of ſo great a clog, they may the better gird up the loyns of their minds, and be more watchfull and ſober. And I pray note, that my Author himſelf pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them (f) <hi>foule offenders, falſe worſhippers of God and idolatrous</hi> (a thing which themſelves (vile wretches) would never yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) yet is he not willing to have them removed, yet or juſtly taxed, for he unjuſtly imputes their juſtly deſerved puniſhment to ſuch as have been puniſhed by them for diſobedience to <hi>their</hi> (g)
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall Laws, and ſuch as are all affected to government.</hi> I verily beleeve no man hath proſecuted them, as they have been <hi>inſtruments</hi> under God to afflict him: but as they have been ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Jeſus Chriſt and his members, depreſſours of true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and promoters of falſe: not for <hi>executing their laws,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they falſly executed them, and turned juſtice into perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not puniſhing men for diſobedience, but for conſcience. For the Papiſt, the Atheiſt, the drunkard, and whoremonger, and prophane perſon whatſoever, that would but bow down
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:156665:16"/> and do them homage, ſhould not onely have peace, but be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by them; but the good and the godly, even the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſcionable Miniſters and Servants of Chriſt Jeſus, that would not, nor durſt for their Lord and Maſters ſake and their own ſouls, fall down and worſhip them, were the onely objects of their Romiſh power and tyranny, uſing their Laws onely as ſpiders webs to take the painfull Bee and harmleſſe Flie in, and ſo to make a prey of them. They do not therefore ſuffer for the very <hi>èxecution of their</hi> (h) <hi>office:</hi> but becauſe they have perverted and neglected it, and intermedled with matters that they ought not; they would be Courtiers, Stateſmen, Lawyers, Polititians, Magiſtrates, nay <note n="*" place="margin">Witneſſe, that <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale,</hi> the war between us and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

<hi>contrary to thoſe their Eccleſiaſticall Laws,</hi> I cannot judge them puniſhment worthy, albeit I know they have had it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert, for they did neither act nor omit any thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, on purpoſe to oppoſe, but in tenderneſſe of conſcience, becauſe their Laws commanded things Gods Word forbids; and prohibites what God commands: and whether it be better to pleaſe God or man, judge ye? <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. for in truth many things are compriſed in their Laws that are neither of God nor Chriſt, nor according to reaſon, but like thoſe prodigious Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons they laſt made, thinking therewith to blowe up the whole Kingdom, at leaſt wiſe to have blown out all godlineſſe and good men. But (praiſed be God) the ſnare is broken, and we are delivered, and they themſelves are blaſted with their own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156665:16"/> Nor can <hi>unity and</hi> (k) <hi>peace</hi> be within their principles. For Chriſt the Prince of peace and Head of his Church never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any ſuch Conſtitutions, or

And could it be otherwiſe? for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the houſe being contrary to the Maſters will, muſt on neceſſitie beget a reluctancy in the ſervants, and produce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and diviſion.

For it hath been their common courſe to juſtifie the wicked, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the righteous; therefore is that curſe their due, threatned in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 23. and that becauſe people will not for conſcience ſake, ſuffer or ſubject unto an unreaſonable and moſt unlawfull ſpirituall power, they will not therefore bear with, and ſubmit unto a moſt lawfull temporall power, it followeth not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:156665:17"/> that they will be the more obedient according to the word, becauſe they are ſo conſcientious, and fearfull to offend the Lord.

            <p>True it is that many things which ſeem (p) <hi>hurtfull</hi> at the <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> firſt may in due time prove very good: in taſte they may be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in digeſtion profitable. But it muſt be conſidered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things be ſimply evill, and fundamentally; or by occaſion, and accidentally. Now what is ſimply evill and fundamentally,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156665:17"/> can never prove good, nor produce any otherwiſe then God by his all ruling providence, ſhall diſpoſe it, but that is not thank-worthy to the inſtrument. And ſuch is the power and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the preſent Biſhops, and therefore both we and ours need never fear (p) <hi>repentance</hi> for ſeeking to have them removed, but (q) <hi>heartily praiſe God if it may be granted.</hi> I know it is poſſible to have (r) <hi>good men for Biſhops,</hi> but then they muſt be choſen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Goſpel (and not after the Articles of their Doctrine) <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 15. 24. to the end, and 14. 23. and not one Biſhop be elected by another as they are, receiving the holy Ghoſt from ſuch as (may be ſuſpected) never had it. And my Author and the whole world (in my opinion) do mightily miſtake whileſt they imagine, that ſuch externall (s) <hi>ſtate and greatneſſe</hi> is requiſite in the Miniſters of the Church. This was that deluſion wherewith the devill blinded the eyes of the poore Jews: they looked for a triumphing Meſſias with ſtately atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and in pompous trappings; but lo he cometh meekly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on an Aſſe. Surely if outward ſtate and glory had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for Chriſts Church, He himſelf being her head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would have put it on, and left it for a rule and an example to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, eſpecially at that time when he came from heaven to marry her and occupied the place of a Bridegroome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. But we do neither find it in his perſon for imitation, nor in his doctrine for direction: nay his rules are contrary, and ſo were his Apoſtles practiſes. <hi>Paul</hi> that Architect in the houſe of God, and chief Planter of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, although moſt worthy (if any more then other) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live in mean eſtate, not ſeeking his own but the good of others. I find not in all the new Teſtament that any of them had either lands or livings, (I am ſure not glebe or Eccleſiaſticall as they call them) if they had other they did ſell and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 45. and 4. 37. no nor ſet allowance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they eat of the fruit of their labours, as is moſt juſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1. to the 24. and it is our duty to take care for them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 27. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. But I know no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for any poſitive means. The Leviticall Law is aboliſhed, tithes and tents are certainly ended; the Prieſthood being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, their rights are likewiſe changed: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 12. and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156665:18"/> the Apoſtles were not ignorant both of the force and extent of this Law. I ſpeak not this to abaſe the Miniſterie, or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any in their neglect or diſreſpect toward them: The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his hire, and (God forbid) but they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. and that comfortably void of care. For if the ſervant of the old Law was ſo honourable, much more is the Miniſter of the new. How beautifull are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 7. But (again I ſay) I conceive neither rule nor reaſon, why they ſhould have ſo many thouſands, and ſo many hundreds <hi>per annum:</hi> tithe of all, even to an egge: yea and all will hardly <note n="*" place="margin">Witneſſe that unreaſonable demand, and unſatiable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of 2. s. 9. d. in the pound.</note> ſuffice, being moſt of them too much like thoſe greedy dogges in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. 11. for by theſe means they become puft up, and ſet themſelves in competition with the men of this world, contending for preheminence and priority, forgetting that godlineſſe is great gain, and that they ought to teach the Goſpel of a <note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtus ob gratiam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, non mune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris mundi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandus eſt.</note> ready mind, and not for filthy lucre: they plough not in hope, they threſh not in hope as the Apoſtles did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10.

<hi>No peny, no Pater noſter.</hi> Theſe things have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to mind the Fleece onely, and not the Flock, and given them horns to gore the poore Saints of God. And beſides, for theſe
<note n="*" place="margin">Quiſquis ad praemia velox.</note> things ſake, have many crept into the folds, who have not been ſhepherds, but ravening wolves. And I have obſerved, that corruption came firſt into the primitive Church by the doore of ambition: and the coveting of worldly pomp and dignitie was the very Baſis of the Seat of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the firſt ſtep of the Beaſt his throne; for under the colour that exterior wealth and power would elevate and advance Religion, crept up that man (not of God, but) of ſinne, with all his lordly train. But ſome will ſay, was it not for theſe incouragements, few or none would apply themſelves to the Miniſterie. I commend incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, it is not the uſe but the abuſe, not the end but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:156665:18"/> and unequall diſpoſing of it I condemne. And fear not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers whileſt there is a harveſt, for God hath promiſed to ſend (or thruſt) forth Labourers into his harveſt; and to that end hath he commanded us to pray unto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 38. he will make his word in all thoſe whom he appointeth unto this work, as it was in the Prophet, like fire, they cannot withhold it, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep it in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 9. it will be more then their meat to them or any worldly reſpect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 32. 34. Now the glory of the Church (Chriſts Spouſe) and of all her Miniſters, is inward in the graces of the ſpirit: God hath choſen the poore of this world rich in faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. and the weak things of this world to confound the wiſe, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. 28. <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within, Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. It is the propriety of a harlot out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to paint and adorn her ſelf: but the honeſt woman aray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelf in comely apparell with ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſty, as it becometh one profeſſing the fear of God: 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3. Thus doth the Spouſe of Chriſt, whoſe apparelling is not outward, but the hid man of the heart; her voice is ſweet (but not ſeducing) her ſight is comely (but not gorgious,) <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. Here I have ſomewhat digreſſed, becauſe moſt conceive that outward eſtate is ſo exceedingly advantagious to the Church of God. But I ſay ſuch abundance is rather diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, as wofull experience palpably teſtifies: and the Apoſtle ſaith, that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, (that is, in the things of this life) but righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt (in vertue and grace) and he that in theſe things ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved to men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17, 18. Wealth indeed is good and profitable, but it edifieth not: Let us follow therefore after the things which make for peace, and the things wherewith one may edifie another: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. Now I come to my Author: To whom I grant, yea I fear that others though (t) <hi>inferiour</hi> in place and power to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhops, may prove as
<hi>imperious and tyrannicall</hi> as they have been, if not worſe; and it is moſt probable if they be not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen and conſtituted. And who knoweth if that little horn ſpoken of in
<hi>Daniel,</hi> 7. 8. be not now to come up? For it muſt riſe up among the ten horns in ſome of the ten kingdoms, &amp; this ſhall look well, but it ſhall ſpeak big, and before it there ſhall be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:156665:19"/> three of the firſt horns plucked up by the roots, it may be <hi>A. S. H.</hi> but I propheſie not, nor am I a Prophets ſonne. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is juſtly to be feared (and may be expected) that yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Nation there will be a generall apoſtaſie in Religion, which in fine will produce a generall deſolation.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, that though there be obſtacles and mountains in the way, and the ſuppoſed</hi> (u) <hi>enemies of Gods Church and children: yet as I am a Chriſtian I</hi> (w)
<hi>dare not judge them, or curſe them, as they do or uſe any unlawfull</hi> (x) <hi>means to remove them, or under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of pulling down one Babell to ſet up another. What</hi> David

            </p>
            <p>That there are <hi>mountains in the way and</hi> (u) <hi>enemies to the Church and children of God,</hi> my Author acknowledgeth; but <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note>

Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I confeſſe, is onely proper to the Lord, and ſo is ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: nor may we either curſe or proſecute for any perſonall injury; yet of their outward actions and obſtinate tranſgreſſions we may judge, and ought to be jealous of them, untill we ſee ſome aſſured teſtimony of their good will to Zion. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 26, 27. and have we not good cauſe to ſuſpect thoſe for <hi>inveterate and</hi> (y) <hi>incurable foes,</hi> that in ſtead of confeſſing and repenting their Popiſh ſuperſtition and Ceremonies, uſurpation and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenoe over Gods people, do ſtill perſiſt therein, and

And under favour ſo farre forth as they manifeſt themſelves the profeſſed foes of Chriſt and his Kingdom, I hold it lawfull to curſe them, and that without

Even ſo let thine enemies periſh O Lord: But they that love him ſhall be as the Sun when he riſeth in his ſtrength. And ſo I return to the words of mine Author, as followeth,

7. 60. not as they are publique and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable foes of Chriſt and his Church. <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, to all that love not the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And for praying for all Governours; I agree with him<hi>:</hi> provided they be in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority, and with his own concluſion, that we may live godly under them in all peace and quietneſſe; the which we muſt not expect under the Biſhops. That long peace and plenty under the Goſpel hath
<hi>produced</hi> (e) <hi>ill effects in us as well as our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> is undeniable. And we are all (like a ſhip that hath laine long ſtill in harbour) over grown with the moſſe and ſlime of corrupting ſecuritie: and what then? Muſt we therefore any longer abide therein? God forbid. Let us up rather and be doing, and the Lord will proſper us. Let our ſleeping Commanders be either rowſed, or with ſupine <hi>Jonas</hi> be caſt over board, better they then the whole veſſell, the Nation, periſh. And let our great Barke of Church and State be careined, have her very keele turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upward, ſcraped, ſearched, calked, rigged, and trimmed, and ſo faithfully maned out again, to the aſtoniſhment of our foes, and the rejoycing of all thoſe which are imbarked in her, and wiſh well unto her. And although <hi>the</hi> (f)
<hi>lawfull commands</hi> of evill governours are to be obeyed, yet it argueth not, that evill Governours are to be tolerated. And indeed it is well, nay a Miracle, and a man hath ſpeciall cauſe <hi>to</hi> (g) <hi>thank God,</hi> if his Governours being evill, command nothing but what is lawfull: But can an ill tree bring forth good fruit? <hi>raro aut nunquam:</hi> very ſeldom, or do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? if it be ſo, is it not by an overruling hand? are not the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tethered? doth not the Almighty turn their wrath to his praiſe? and reſtrain the reſt of their rage? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 10. yea and bridle their thoughts too. But we have much more cauſe to praiſe God, when our Governours be good, men of courage, fearing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:156665:21"/> God, and hating covetouſneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. then may we with boldneſſe expect both good commands, and good effects, and bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 17. True it is that we muſt (h) <hi>do our duty,</hi> and perform on our parts, though the Governours be wicked and fail on theirs, for their neglect ſhall not excuſe ours: every veſſell ſhall ſtand on his own bottome. Yet for ſuch Governours as are not lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and authoriſed, as the Biſhops, it is a
<hi>Quaere:</hi> what duty is there due, whether any. So I come to what followeth, <hi>fol.</hi>
11. <hi>videlicet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, I dare not but look at the hand of God, and not at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Author.</note> 
               <hi>onely of my afflictions; I know nothing can come to paſſe but by his permiſſion, I am aſſured that</hi> (i) <hi>ſin is the prime cauſe of all my ſufferings, and I fear that ingratitude in not being thankefull, and walking worthy of thoſe great mercies received, hath been a principall cauſe why God hath ſhut the hearts of ſome of our Governours at this preſent as is much feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This whole argument is good and godly (let the Devill have <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> his due) and worthy of practiſe in all Proteſtants; yet it tends nothing to prove that the Petitions, againſt which my Author hath undertaken his diſcourſe, are unlawfull, or that the authors of them hath therein acted any thing either againſt God or man. And I do confeſſe, that for the wickednes of a people, God ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wicked Governors, and <hi>that</hi> (i)
<hi>ſin is the prime cauſe of all our miſeries:</hi> But that <hi>ingratitude,</hi> or other ſin of the people, is <hi>the principall cauſe why God doth ſhut up the hearts of Governours,</hi> I do deny: that is their own wickedneſſe. Witneſſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23. 26. Many people have ſuffered for their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but to my knowledge I never read, that ever any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſuffered for the people. <hi>Saul</hi> the hypocrite dealeth falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſlayeth the Gibeonites, but the people endure three yeers famine for it: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 1, 2. So <hi>David</hi> ſinneth, but the people are plagued, 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 7. 17. For the ſin of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> the King, was all Judah carried captive, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24. 3, 4. And were they not the high Prieſts and Elders that crucified Chriſt? yet was the whole Nation therefore deſtroyed. And that it is the Governors own ſin that cauſeth God to harden them, I further prove it thus. They having a will to fin, and no regard unto God, nor
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:156665:21"/> unto his word, therefore doth he in his juſt judgement give them up to a reprobate mind, to do things that are not convenient: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. 30. Had Gods Word been by <hi>Saul</hi> regarded, <hi>Saul</hi> by God had never been rejected. And thus fall they to ſin the more freely, and abuſe their authoritie, eating up Gods people as bread, untill God by their hand hath ſufficiently puniſhed them: and then doth he break thoſe rods in peeces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them in his wrath, for the evill of the people ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their ungodly government, no nor extenuate their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo I proceed again as followeth, <hi>fo.</hi>

               <hi>the exceution of his judgements on the world he will begin at his own houſe, either to work out ſin, or to work in grace, or to make that grace more manifeſt which is already wrought. I know that the end of Gods correction is reformation, till then if ſmaller afflictions will not prevail, greater ſhall; if not one kind then another: if the ſword of our enemies do not, the ſwords peradventure of our own amongſt our ſelves ſhall; if not they, peradventure the peſtilence, or the famine, or ſome other ſhall: ſundrie of which ſometimes come together to let the world know, that our afflictions come not immediate from any one</hi> (k) <hi>ſecondary or inſtrumental cauſe but that it is from the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Almighty, ſo to order and to diſpoſe it, who will not take off his judgements as the effects, till our ſins as the cauſe be removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein likewiſe is nothing to be gainſaid. Onely I muſt ſtill <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> notifie, that whatſoever is here alledged, doth not juſtifie mine Authors <hi>clandeſtine</hi> aſperſions againſt the aforementioned Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners and Petitions, or any wayes condemne therein either their actions or perſons. That our afflictions come not <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from any</hi> (k) <hi>ſecondarie cauſe,</hi> who knoweth not? Is there evill in the City and God doth it not? <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 38. Yet this doth not therefore prove, that ſuch inſtruments as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

And as mine Author would not have us account the Biſhops the immediate cauſe of our perturbation and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo I wiſh he would adviſe them not to take us for the onely cauſe of their ſhamefull fall and confuſion, but their own deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impietie and abomination: the which the righteous Lord hath juſtly brought on the heads of them to the aſtoniſhment of the whole earth. So I come again to his own words, <hi>fo.</hi> 13.

And then to apply my ſelf with all diligence to all lawfull means to remove them; yet I am not to put too much</hi> (n) <hi>confidence in them, I could never yet find any benefit by</hi> (o) <hi>impatience under the hand of the Almighty, I have found more afflictions procured thereby, and I am aſſured that the Church and children of God never loſt by their</hi> (p) <hi>patient ſuffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What this man (l) <hi>dare not do,</hi> I am ſure as yet we have not <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> done, as hath been plainly proved, albeit he ſecretly involves our rebuke, in his <hi>dare not.</hi> For as not he, ſo no man can prove a petitionary way unlawfull: and other means then humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and modeſt ſolicitations there hath been none uſed by us, (excepting that principall means <hi>of</hi> (m) <hi>humiliation</hi> by himſelf ſo much preferred, the which by the goodneſſe of our King and Parliament hath rather been preſident then ſubſequent to our other endeavours.) And I verily beleeve men have been ſo farre from putting <hi>too much</hi> (n) <hi>confidence in the uſe of means,</hi> as that they have not given due credit to the promiſe of God made unto them. For how many but a while ſince did even deſpaire <note n="*" place="margin">Witneſſe every mans arming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his guard.</note>? not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the means uſed.

And now the waters are moved, &amp; God hath ſent his Angel to cure us, ſhall we not ſtir? ſhall we not enter? ſhall we not lay hold upon ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie an occaſion? if we cannot make means our ſelves, we may with the lame man at the pool of Betheſda, ſit ſtill long enough: there are none ſo charitable (many otherwiſe) to make means for us. We have not with the traiterous Papiſts, rebelled for our oppreſſions, but like a woman with child patiently waited, (though in great anguiſh) the Lords appointed time for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and it being come, and we in pain, may we not ſeek for help to the Midwife of our heavy burthens? the skilfull Parliament: yes doubtleſſe lawfully, and ready and willing are

And as never any <hi>through</hi> (p) <hi>patience</hi> in obedience to Gods will, hath in the end been damnified: ſo I am confident we ſhall not; but on the contrary be greatly benefited, for he that hath begun the good work for us, will not fail to perfect it. And ſo I come again to mine Authors own words,
<hi>fol.</hi> 13. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly, as I know that Gods</hi> (q) <hi>decree in his determination of</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Author.</note> 
               <hi>judgements ſhall be fulfilled, ſo I am confidently aſſured, that when the time of his deliverance is come, all the power and ſubtilty of the devill and his inſtruments, as they ſhall go no further then he hath limited them, ſo they ſhall not hinder him from taking off his rod when he pleaſeth. For he is able to bring his will to paſſe by means without</hi> (r) <hi>means, and contrary to means, rather then his children ſhall not have their due reliefe. The</hi> (s) <hi>Sea ſhall part, the earth ſhall open and ſwallow up their adverſaries; or fire ſhall come down from heaven and deſtroy them. And this may</hi> (t) <hi>comfort Chriſtians, that God reignes and rules as King in heaven, the cauſe of his Church and children is his, and he beholds and governs the inhabitants of the earth, he hath the hearts of all in his hand, he can turn them or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them when he pleaſeth for the good of his: when our wayes pleaſe him, he can make our enemies be at peace with us, and the ſame hand to heal us that hath wounded us, it is he onely that can make men to be of one heart, and one mind, and to make all things to work together for the beſt of them that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing here but what is truth; Onely to me he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſubtilly to inſinuate, that becauſe whatſoever God hath (q)
<hi>decreed</hi> cannot be altered or averted, we muſt therefore ſit ſtill and do nothing, like thoſe deſperate wretches, who ſay, if God hath ordained me to be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved; if he have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me to be damned, I ſhall be damned: what can I do? But this ought not ſo to be. It behoveth us in the morning to ſowe our ſeed, and in the evening not to withhold our hand, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and conſtant in the uſe of all good means, omitting no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, for who knoweth whether ſhall proſper, this or that, or whether both ſhall be alike good? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 6. we muſt do our endeavour, and refer the iſſue to God; who doth all things after his own good pleaſure. True it is, that God can ſave
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:156665:23"/> (r) <hi>without means, and by contrary means,</hi> but he ſeldome or never doth either, unleſſe means be wanting, or that in caſe all means being uſed, have failed; then in a caſe extraordinary he will ſhew himſelf glorious for the deliverance of his Church, to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a name that his enemies may be aſtoniſhed, and his people incouraged to truſt in him. Such was the deliverance of Iſrael out of Egypt: and the blind mans receiving ſight with ſpittle mixt with clay. But when the Iſraelites came to enter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, they muſt uſe the means (the ſword) for it, if they will have it: although they could not divide the Sea, yet they can fight: And becauſe they are afraid and will not fight, they ſhall wander fourty yeers longer, and periſh every one that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing. God could as eaſily have ſlain the Canaanites for them, as he did the Egyptians, and ſo at once have given them poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but he would not, the purchaſe would have been too cheap: they would not have valued the prize. And therefore when they come to win that ſtrong City Jericho, they muſt take pains, and apply themſelves to means, though it be but walking and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Rams horns. God doth not make miracles his everie dayes work, though truly we may ſay to his glory, that of late he hath daily ſhewed miracles amongſt us: But for the moſt part they have been by his bleſſing through the uſe of means, though weak and mean; and therefore let us not be idle, but ſtill be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Mine Author appeareth plainly to be of their mind (at leaſt his arguments tend to that end) who ſay, <note n="*" place="margin">And others, who thank God their hand is to none of their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to the Proteſtation.</note> what need we trouble our ſelves to petition, is not the Parliament wiſe enough? do they not know what they have to do? Yea undoubtedly, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we can teach them; and without queſtion they are moſt wiſe. Yet (under favour) I beleeve not ſo fully wiſe, as altogether needleſſe of inſtruction and advice: And though moſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet not ſo perfectly knowing, as not to ſtand in need of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation &amp; advertiſement. I have known parents hearken unto children. And
<hi>Eli</hi> that old Judge of Iſrael adviſed with &amp; heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto young <hi>Samuel,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 3. 17, 18. but this by permiſſion. My Authors perſwaſion, wherewith he laboureth to have us do nothing, but fit &amp; expect miracles from heaven, is much like that I have read of a certain Jew after Chriſt, who becauſe God in old time had miraculouſly brought the Jews by the hand of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:156665:23"/> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> through the Sea, perſwaded the people that God would do the like for them by him, and ſo brought moſt of them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh miſerably in the waters: Even ſo this man infers. As if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God can do ſuch mighty things <hi>as he</hi> (s)
<hi>reckons,</hi> and hath formerly by his marvellous power delivered others, &amp; us alſo, as in that Gunpowder-plot of the Papiſts, miraculouſly and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without us, that therefore he will do ſo now. But have we not found, and God by proof hath cauſed us to know, that if we had been thus minded, we almoſt all, before this had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? For the reſt of his eighth aſſertion, that it <hi>may</hi> (t) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Chriſtians, that God reigneth in heaven, rules in the earth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the cauſe of his children to be his, &amp;c. and turneth all to the beſt of them that love him,</hi> I acknowledge. But as it may ſerve for <hi>comfort</hi> to Gods Church and people; ſo may it ſerve for terrour and diſcomfort to all that are his enemies, and oppoſe his Church; for God is a moſt ſevere Avenger of their wrongs. And ſo I come to my Authors concluſion, <hi>fo.</hi> 15. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude, I hope by this time you have received full</hi> (v) <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Author.</note> 
               <hi>why I have refuſed to ſubſcribe. Yet let me</hi> (w) <hi>aſſure you, that if the Parliament ſhall think fit to alter that government, I dare not in conſcience and duty to the Proteſtation, refuſe to be governed by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now mine Author thinks that by his ſlight ſophiſticall <note place="margin">Anſwer:</note> arguments he hath (u) <hi>ſatisfied</hi> the whole world for his non ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, hoping by this means alſo to dehort many others. And truly amongſt the ignorant, ſquint-eyed, and neutrall, his aſſertions may much prevail, and his Pamphlet have more faith from them then the Bible. But to the judicious, zealous, &amp; more quick-ſighted, he very obviouſly diſcovereth himſelf for an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and one much to be ſuſpected, inſomuch that we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay to him (for all his faire pretences) as it was ſometime ſaid by <hi>Joram</hi> to <hi>Jehu, Is it peace, I. W.?</hi> yet there is hope of him, for in his cloſe he (w) <hi>aſſureth us that if the Parliament ſhall alter the preſent government, he will in conſcience and duty ſubmit unto it.</hi> Indeed it is well ſpoken at laſt, and in charity I will beleeve what he hath ſpoken. Yet my opinion is, that his obedience will be more of neceſſitie then good will. For how can he, or any man, freely and with affection yeeld obedience to that government
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:156665:24"/> which he never willed, or deſired: and that he deſireth no change or reformation (albeit the preſent eſtate of the Church is moſt corrupt) is apparant by his applauding and ſervent pleading for it, and his ſtrong oppoſition againſt thoſe who ſeek the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of it. And ſo I come to his perſwaſion (as I may terme it) annexed to his concluſion, <hi>fol.</hi> 15. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be confident that not onely my prayers, but my true</hi> (x) <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Author.</note> 
               <hi>have been, and by Gods grace ſhall continue, for Reformation. I know</hi> (y) <hi>God hath ſuffered many of his deare Saints and children to fall into great and hainous ſins and offences, yet when he hath duely chaſtiſed them, after true repentance he hath made them greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his glory, and the good of his Church, then in former times they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he ſheweth mighty (x) <hi>zealous for reformation:</hi> but if he <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> mean that Reformation <note n="*" place="margin">In the Church.</note> I do, I cannot be ſo confident as he bids me; my reaſons are demonſtrated in my laſt words above. But I conceive he intends ſome perſonall reformation either in himſelf, or the Biſhops, and ſo his ſucceeding words do imply. <hi>I</hi> (y) <hi>know God, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe there he ſpeaks that though God hath ſuffered him or them the
<note n="*" place="margin">Did not a Biſhop or his Chaplain frame the book? without queſtion he is a Biſhops Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, one that hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome other ghoſtly gift from them.</note> Biſhops, as <hi>his deare Saints and children to fall into great and hainous ſins, yet when he hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently chaſtiſed them</hi> (as now his rod is upon them) <hi>after their true repentance he will make them greater inſtruments of his glory then ever.</hi> Well I together with him do pray (if God ſo will) for this reformation in them. But in the <hi>interim</hi> I ſhall be in travell and never at reſt, untill that long wiſhed for Reformation in the Church be accompliſhed. For I deſire not to ſtay till they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and made ſuch glorious inſtruments, leſt it never be, and that God hath no ſuch love unto them, for they have hated his truth, and loved lies. And thus do I accede to his following words, which I may juſtly terme an anticipation, as is manifeſt, <hi>fol.</hi> 15. <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>for</hi> (a) <hi>truth and peace your uſuall jears, ſcoffes, and cenſures, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and the like: but my comfort is, that God knoweth</hi> (b) <hi>who are his, and who are the true friends and enemies of the Church and State, and that I have ſincerely diſcharged my conſcience, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that weak talent I have received in obedience to the</hi> (c) <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation for the good of both.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:156665:24"/> Being conſcious of his own merit, and juſtly fearing reproach
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and hard cenſure for this his work, he cunningly prevents them at whoſe hands he expects it; telling them, that <hi>he</hi> (z) <hi>looketh</hi> for nothing elſe from them for all the good he hath done, as if his work was rather worthy of praiſe then contumacie: and if he was reviled, it was for (a) <hi>truth, and peace,</hi> and not for any evill or hypocriſie, either in his actions or ends. Thus audaciouſly (like a Pontifical) uſing the juſt mans plea for his unjuſt attempts. But that God who knoweth both (b) <hi>who are his, and who are the Churches friends, and foes,</hi> knoweth the ſecret windings of his heart; and if he be contrary minded, will in due time diſcover him.

<hi>although</hi> (f) <hi>hand joyn in hand, the wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed:</hi> let him therfore be warned, and not take part with the ungodly: for the wicked and all that forget God ſhall be turned into hell: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 17. Then my Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth upon (g)
<hi>reformation of any materiall errour, to endeavour reformation alſo.</hi> I hope he will not deny, (if he do the world will juſtifie) that, to maintain that by <note n="*" place="margin">The Authors errours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted.</note> colour of his Proteſtation, which he is thereby bound to oppoſe, and by all good means to ſeek the abolition of, is an errour <hi>materiall</hi> and condemnable. And further, that to vilifie and inveigh againſt thoſe that in pious diſcharge of their conſcience and Proteſtation, have endeavoured the Parliaments ſecurity, and a reformation, and likewiſe by cunning craftineſſe, and ſophiſticall arguments, both to diſſwade others from doing the ſame, and to animate and confirm other ſome in their indifferencie, lukewarmneſſe, and neutralitie, to the great diſhonour of God, their utter ſhame and ſouls-hazard, are <hi>errours</hi> of the ſame nature; all which my Author by his book hath done: But I hope being now <hi>informed,</hi> he will repent of his firſt work, and forthwith fulfill ſtis <hi>laſt</hi> (h) <hi>promiſe.</hi> But he muſt withall be (i)
<hi>convinced</hi> of theſe his errours; The ſame objection hath the blind Jew, concerning Chriſt, againſt all the teſtimony of holy Scriptures: and it is the work of God to convince the conſcience, and not of man. And ſo I will leave him, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better fruits of
<hi>his</hi> (k) <hi>profeſſion,</hi> for by his fruits he <hi>ſhall be</hi> (l)
<hi>known,</hi> according as he <hi>doth</hi> (m) <hi>perſiſt</hi> or deſiſt his
